Part a) Read the data, consider scaling, how do we structure the input
for the different algorithms

Plot some timeseries, diffs and histogram plots to look at outliers

Part b)

You need to include at least two central algorithms, 
or as an alternative explore methods from decisions tree to bagging,
random forests and boosting. 
Explain the basics of the methods you have chosen to work with. 
This would be your theory part.

k-NN classification and Autoencoders - setup and methods

Part c)

Then describe your algorithm and its implementation and tests you have performed.

Tests: 
*   classification of 2025 dataset and 2024 dataset compare against 
    hand done flagging
*   attempt to flag out values from 2024 using 2025 as a baseline

Part d)

Then presents your results and findings, link with existing literature and more.
what it says on the tin

Part e)
Finally, here you should present a critical assessment
of the methods you have studied and link your results 
with the existing literature.

Again, what it says on the tin.
