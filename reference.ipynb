        "High fidelity measurements in engineering often produce vectors with hundreds or thousands of degrees of freedom, yet the dominant behavior is driven by a small number of patterns. **Dimensionality reduction** finds those low rank coordinates. By projecting data onto a smaller subspace we obtain a tractable description, filter noise, and reveal structure that is hard to see in the raw variables. Importantly, this is done **without labels**: the directions are inferred from statistical regularities in the snapshots.\n",

        "# Sparse PCA: purpose, differences from PCA\n",
        "\n",
        "## What it is\n",
        "Sparse PCA (SPCA) is a low-rank factorization that finds components (loadings) which are **sparse** across sensors (features). The goal is the same spirit as PCA \"compress and reveal structure\" but with **localized, interpretable modes** rather than dense ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "Typical uses:\n",
        "- Interpretability: highlight **where** variability lives (support maps).\n",
        "- Sensor selection and placement: identify a **small subset of sensors** that explain most variation.\n",
        "- Region-of-interest analysis and feature selection in high-dimensional data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key differences vs standard PCA\n",
        "- **PCA** has a closed-form SVD on centered data. Modes are **dense**, **orthogonal**, and **variance-ordered**; the squared singular values equal explained variance.\n",
        "- **SPCA** solves an **optimization with sparsity penalties**, not an SVD. Components are **sparse**, generally **not orthogonal**, and **not variance-ordered**. Explained variance is assessed via reconstruction fit rather than singular values.\n",
        "- SPCA trades a bit of fidelity for **localization and interpretability**.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The optimization problem\n",
        "With centered data matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times F}$, SPCA approximates\n",
        "$\n",
        "X \\approx C W,\n",
        "$\n",

        "\\quad \\text{s.t.} \\quad \\lVert C_{:j} \\rVert_2 \\le 1 \\ \\forall j,\n",
        "$\n",
        "where:\n",
        "- $W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r \\times F}$ are the **sparse loadings** (spatial components);\n",
        "- $C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times r}$ are the **codes** (temporal activations);\n",
        "- $\\alpha$ controls sparsity (larger \\(\\alpha\\) means more zeros);\n",

        "\n",
        "The problem is solved iteratively (alternating minimization with Lasso-type steps). There is no single SVD step.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why standardization and why scale matters\n",
        "The sparsity penalty $\\lVert W \\rVert_1$ acts **per feature**. If features have different scales, large-variance features are **implicitly cheaper** to keep nonzero, and small-variance ones are over-penalized. Therefore we:\n",
        "- **Standardize features** (mean 0, variance 1) **before** SPCA;\n",
        "- Fit SPCA in standardized space;\n",
        "- **Map components and reconstructions back** to original physical units using the inverse transform when we visualize or compare to PCA.\n",
        "\n",
        "Without standardization, sparsity patterns largely reflect **units** rather than **structure**.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Disadvantages vs PCA\n",
        "- No orthogonality or variance ordering; components can be **correlated** and their scale/sign are arbitrary.\n",
        "- **No closed form**; requires **hyperparameters** ($\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $r$) and may converge to **local minima**. Slower than PCA.\n",
        "- Explained variance is **not** read from singular values; reconstruction fit is typically **worse** than PCA for the same number of components.\n",
        "- Results depend on **standardization choices** and can be less stable across runs or slight data changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## When to pick SPCA\n",
        "Choose SPCA when **where** matters more than squeezing out the last bit of variance: you want localized, interpretable patterns or a small set of informative sensors. Use PCA when you want the **best energy capture** and orthogonal modes for compression and low-rank modeling.\n",

        "## Classification / clustering\n",
        "When no labels guide us, clustering becomes our lens for discovering latent groupings—“natural categories” that emerge purely from the geometry of the data cloud.  Formally we are looking for a partition of the point set $\\{\\mathbf{x}_i\\}_{i=1}^N\\subset\\mathbb{R}^p$ that makes members of the same cluster more similar to one another than to points outside.  Yet similarity is in the eye of the algorithm.  **$k$-means** measures it with global Euclidean distance from movable centroids and therefore prefers compact, roughly spherical groups; **hierarchical linkage** builds a full dendrogram by agglomerating the closest pairs, exposing structure at every scale but forcing the analyst to decide where to “cut” the tree. We will illustrate these biases with a deliberately eclectic 2‑D toy set that combines tight Gaussian blobs, an elongated cigar, a curved crescent and a sprinkling of stray points.  Watching each method succeed on some shapes and stumble on others makes vivid the central lesson: clustering is not a one‑size‑fits‑all tool but a family of algorithms whose output reflects the particular notion of proximity they encode.\n",

        "The sequence of merges is recorded in a **dendrogram**, a binary tree whose leaves are individual samples and whose branch heights mark the linkage distances at which clusters fused. Cutting the dendrogram with a horizontal line at height $h$ yields the partition first produced when inter‑cluster distance exceeded $h$; sliding this cut interactively exposes structure from fine to coarse scales. Single linkage will keep the crescent intact at low cuts but may chain noise into it; Ward will absorb noise into variance‑minimising groups yet cleanly separates the tight Gaussian blobs. Other linkage choices—complete, average, centroid—sit between these two, balancing sensitivity to chaining against a bias for compactness, but today’s exercise with single and Ward already reveals how the linkage metric encodes geometric assumptions that fundamentally shape the resulting clusters.\n",

        "In anomaly detection we flip the usual learning question: instead of modelling *all* the variability in a data set, we first build a notion of what “normal” looks like and then flag samples that fall outside that description. Because true anomalies are typically rare and unlabeled, the task is almost always **unsupervised**. The output is not a class but a **score**—higher means “more unusual”—followed by a threshold that decides whether to raise an alarm. Setting that threshold is part of the problem: too low and the system cries wolf, too high and genuine faults slip through. Practical recipes fix it by an assumed contamination rate (e.g. the highest 2 % of scores) or by cross‑checking against domain limits.\n",
        "\n",
        "Different algorithms operationalise “unusual” in different ways. Local methods, such as the $k$-nearest‑neighbour distance score, compare each point only to its immediate neighbourhood and are quick to spot sparse outliers in dense clouds. Global boundary methods like the One‑Class SVM enclose the bulk of the data in a flexible surface and mark anything outside as suspect; they cope better when “normal” fills an irregular but connected region. In the following sections we apply $k$-NN to a synthetic pulsatile‑pressure trace, showing how the choice of score and threshold trades false positives against missed detections. Other methods can be found in the extra material.\n",
        "\n",
        "We begin by generating the data. The raw data will be a time-series of pressure measurements, with faults such as dropouts and spikes injected into the data set and some Gaussian noise. For the classification, the signal will be divided into windows and the four statistical measures will be used to analyse the windows (mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis)."

        "The **One‑Class SVM** builds a *global* envelope around the training data by learning a decision function that is positive on “normal” samples and negative elsewhere. In scikit‑learn this is implemented as the ν‑formulation of the support‑vector machine: given only the uncontaminated portion of the data, the algorithm maps each point into a high‑dimensional feature space (by default with an RBF kernel) and then finds the hyper‑plane that maximises its distance from the origin while allowing at most a fraction ν of the training points to fall on the wrong side. Geometrically, this hyper‑plane translates back into input space as a smooth, flexible boundary containing roughly $(1\\!-\\!ν)\\times100\\%$ of the data. The signed distance to that boundary is returned by `decision_function`; scikit‑learn’s `predict` simply labels negative distances as anomalies.\n",

        "* **`kernel`** – RBF (default) captures non‑linear shapes; linear and polynomial are available for strictly convex data.\n",
        "* **`gamma`** – inverse squared length‑scale of the RBF; `'scale'` (default) sets it to $1/(p · \\text{var}(X))$, but tuning tighter (larger gamma) shrinks the envelope, flagging more points.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because the model optimises a global objective, it is less sensitive than kNN to local sampling density and can enclose an irregular yet connected “normal” region without fragmenting it. Pre‑processing the data with a `StandardScaler` is essential: the kernel uses Euclidean distance, so unscaled features distort the boundary. Once fitted, the One‑Class SVM scores new observations in $O(N_{\\text{SV}} p)$ time, where $N_{\\text{SV}}$ is the number of support vectors, making it fast enough for real‑time monitoring after the initial training pass.\n",

        "Once the data have been converted into a weighted (or unweighted) graph, clustering can be phrased as cutting that graph into two or more pieces: remove a set of edges so that the remaining connected components become the clusters. A naïve strategy would be to sort all edges by weight and simply delete the weakest ones until the graph falls apart. This works on toy data but quickly shows its limitations: a single noisy point may detach prematurely, elongated clusters may shatter into chains, and large clusters are penalised because they contain more edges in absolute terms. In other words, how we measure the cost of a cut—and whether we balance that cost by cluster size—matters as much as which edges we remove. In order to continue the discussion we introduce two new matrices, the degree matrix $D$, which is diagonal and defined by $d_{ii} = \\sum_j w_{ij}$, and the Laplacian of the graph $L=D-W$. We must also introduce notions of size on a graph, we usually use two measures of the graph $G$, $|G|$ is the number of vertices (nodes) in the graph, and vol$(G)$ is the diagonal sum of the degree matrix belonging to $G$.\n",
        "\n",

Two widely used objectives embody this idea. *Ratio Cut* divides the inter‑cluster edge weight by the number of vertices on either side, discouraging tiny fragments; *Normalised Cut* divides instead by the total edge weight incident to each side, giving greater protection when degrees vary widely. More formally, we need to introduce a way to measure the connectedness of subgraphs. If $A$ and $B$ are subgraphs, their connectedness is defined as $W(A,B) = \\sum_{i\\in A, j\\in B} w_{ij}$. The values of Ratio Cut and Normalised cut then read\n",
